//Write a class Worker and derive classes DailyWorker and SalariedWorker from it. Every worker has a name and a salary rate.
// Write method ComPay (int hours) to compute the week pay of every worker. A Daily Worker is paid on the basis of the number of days he/she works.
// The Salaried Worker gets paid the wage for 40 hours a week no matter what the actual hours are. Test this program to calculate the pay of workers.
// You are expected to use the concept of polymorphism to write this program.
